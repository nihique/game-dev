# Ember App Kit

Ember App Kit is a foundation for your ambitious web applications built in Ember. It's intended to be used either on its own or as the base scaffolding for generators built on for Ember applications, including [Ember Tools](https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools), [generator-ember](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember), and a hypothetical official executable at some point in the future.

For usage information, please see the [getting started guide](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Features

- (relatively) Sane project structure
- ES6 module transpiler support (easy, future-proof modules)
- Module system-aware resolver
- Simple ember-testing example
- Testing via QUnit, Ember Testing, and Karma
- Project compilation & minification for easy deploys
- Optional CoffeeScript, SASS, and LESS support
- Optional support for package management via [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower)
 
## Future goals

- ES6-aware JSHint
- Source maps for transpiled modules
- Better support for usage in generators
